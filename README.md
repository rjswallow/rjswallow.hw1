# Title: HoriSeon Refactor

The project is an excersise in semantic html. The purpose of correct semantics is to standardise the meaning of information displayed and allow broader access to the website and the information therein across browsers. Semantic html is orderly and helps keep code clean and easy to read, display, and edit. 

**In order to do this project you'll want to be familier with the following semantic tags:** 

<article>
<aside>
<figcaption>
<figure>
<footer>
<header>
<main>
<nav>
<section>
